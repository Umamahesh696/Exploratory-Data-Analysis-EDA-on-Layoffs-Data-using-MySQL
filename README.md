**SQL Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Layoffs Dataset (using Mysql WorkBench):**

**About This Project**: This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Layoffs Dataset from Kaggle. In a previous Data cleaning project, I performed data cleaning where I fixed missing or incorrect information and prepared the data for analysis. Using the cleaned dataset, I then used MySQL to explore layoffs by company, industry, country, funding stage, and time.

The goal was to find out which companies laid off the most people, which industries and countries were hit hardest, and how layoffs changed over time (month by month and year by year). The analysis also showed cases where companies shut down and revealed important global layoff trends.

**Dataset Source:**https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swaptr/layoffs-2022

The same data was used for cleaning and analysis.

**What I Looked At:**

**1.Biggest Layoffs:** Companies with the largest layoffs and full shutdowns.

**2.By Company:** Total layoffs for each company and how layoffs changed each year.

**3.By Industry:** Which industries lost the most jobs.

**4.By Country:** How layoffs were spread across different countries.

**5.Over Time:** Layoffs by date, month, and year.

**6.Company Rankings:** Ranked companies each year based on layoffs using SQL functions.

**Goal:** To find patterns and important insights about layoffs worldwide, so we can understand which companies, industries, and countries were affected most and when.

**Tools Used:**

**1.MySQL Workbench:** To write SQL queries and analyze data.

**2.Kaggle:** dataset source.
